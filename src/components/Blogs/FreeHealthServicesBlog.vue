        <div class="mt-4">
          <h4 class="text-primary">1. Identify Available Services</h4>
          <p>
            Start by researching what free health services are available in your area. Check with community health
            clinics,
            government health departments, and non-profit organizations. Many areas offer services such as general
            medical
            check-ups, immunizations, mental health support, and preventive care.

        <div class="mt-4">
          <h4 class="text-primary">2. Check Eligibility Requirements</h4>
          <p>
            Each service may have its own eligibility criteria. These may be based on your income level, residency, age,
            or
            specific medical needs. Verify the requirements by visiting their websites, calling the service providers,
            or
            speaking with community representatives.

        <div class="mt-4">
          <h4 class="text-primary">3. Schedule an Appointment</h4>
          <p>
            Once you have identified the appropriate services and confirmed your eligibility, the next step is to
            schedule
            an appointment. Many free services require advance booking through an online portal or a community hotline.
            Make
            sure you have any necessary documents ready, such as a valid ID, proof of residence, or income verification.

        <div class="mt-4">
          <h4 class="text-primary">4. Utilize Local Support Networks</h4>
          <p>
            Beyond the clinics and government programs, local non-profit organizations and community groups can offer
            guidance. Reach out through community forums, social media groups, or local government offices to get
            additional
            information and support in accessing these services.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mt-4">
          <h4 class="text-primary">5. Stay Informed</h4>
          <p>
            Health services often update their programs and eligibility criteria. Subscribe to newsletters, follow
            social
            media channels of local health organizations, or regularly check community bulletin boards to stay
            up-to-date on
            new services and upcoming changes.
